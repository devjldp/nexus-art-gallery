            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>Claude Lorrain (1600 – 23 November 1682) was a painter, draughtsman and etcher of the Baroque era originally from the Duchy of Lorraine. He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest significant artists, aside from his contemporaries in Dutch Golden Age painting, to concentrate on landscape painting.</p>

                <p>Nicolas Poussin (June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was a leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. 
                   Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors.</p>

            <h3 class="artist-name text-center">Giovanni Antonio Canal "Canaletto"</h3>
            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>Giovanni Antonio Canal (18 October 1697 – 19 April 1768), commonly known as Canaletto, was an Italian painter from the Republic of Venice, considered an important member of the 18th-century Venetian school.

                    Painter of cityscapes or vedute, of Venice, Rome, and London, he also painted imaginary views (referred to as capricci), although the demarcation in his works between the real and the imaginary is never quite clearcut.</p>

            <h3 class="artist-name text-center">John Constable</h3>
            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>John Constable (11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English landscape painter in the Romantic tradition. 
                    Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for revolutionising the genre of landscape painting with his pictures of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home; now known as "Constable Country"; which he invested with an intensity of affection. 
                    "I should paint my own places best", he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, "painting is but another word for feeling".</p>

            <h3 class="artist-name text-center">Rembrandt</h3>
            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (15 July 1606 – 4 October 1669), mononymously known as Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker, and draughtsman. 
                    He is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of Western art. It is estimated that Rembrandt's surviving works amount to about three hundred paintings, three hundred etchings, and several hundred drawings.
                    Unlike most Dutch painters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of styles and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological subjects and animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period that historians call the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

            <h3 class="artist-name text-center">Vincent van Gogh</h3>
            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>incent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. 
                   In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. 
                   His oeuvre includes landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh's work was only beginning to gain critical attention before his death from suicide at age 37. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard, was sold.</p>

            <h3 class="artist-name text-center">Jan van Eyck</h3>
            <div class="artist-bio">
                <p>Jan van Eyck ( before 1390 – 9 July 1441) was a Flemish painter active in Bruges who was one of the early innovators of what became known as Early Netherlandish painting, and one of the supreme figures of the Early Northern Renaissance. 
                    Such was his legacy, that he has been called “the inventor of oil-painting” by Vasari, Ernst Gombrich, and others, although this claim is now considered an oversimplification.</p>
